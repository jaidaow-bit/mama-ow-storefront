      <p>
        Jaida Ow is a food creator obsessed with peanut butter. She used to buy so much that her mum started making it for her — a naturally sweeter, richer PB with no sugar, no salt, no preservatives, just roasted peanuts. Friends loved it, and Mama Ow was born.

        The brand voice is warm, heartfelt, and family-style — like a friend sharing a family recipe.
